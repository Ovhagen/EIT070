What does the code do?

The code lowers the char value until it has reached its minimum value.

What is the expected value of the variable "b"?

The expected value is b = 127.



##Setup

1. What is the value of the variable “b”?

    * b = 127

2. What is the binary representation of “b”?

   * 0b1111111

3. Are there any changes in the memory?
   * Yes

4. Which memory address is affected?
   * 00001A98

5. Compare the contents of the variable “b” with the contents of the affected memory address. What is the conclusion?
   * They are connected.

6. What is stored at that memory address?
   * b:s value is stored in in that memory slot.

7. Modify the contents of the memory address next to the affected memoryaddress by typing a non-zero value at that address. Does this have any impact on the variable “b”?
   * No it does not.

8. How many bits are required to store a variable of type char?
   * 8 bitar. En byte.

9. Why is the value of the variable “b” larger than 10?
   * Because we can only represent -127 then we start running running down from the maximum value 127.
